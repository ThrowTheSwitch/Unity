Running Tests 
------------- 

RUN_TEST(func)

Each Test is run within the macro RUN_TEST.  This macro performs necessary setup before the test is called and handles cleanup and result tabulation afterwards.

TEST_WRAP(function) 

If the test functions call helper functions and those helper functions have the ability to make assertions, calls to those helpers should be wrapped in a TEST_WRAP macro.  This macro aborts the test if the helper triggered a failure.

--------------
Ignoring Tests
--------------

There are times when a test is incomplete or not valid for some reason.  At these times, TEST_IGNORE can be called.  Control will immediately be returned to the caller of the test, and no failures will be returned.

TEST_IGNORE()

Ignore this test and return immediately

TEST_IGNORE_MESSAGE (message)

Ignore this test and return immediately.  Output a message stating why the test was ignored.

--------------
Aborting Tests
--------------

There are times when a test will contain an infinite loop on error conditions, or there may be reason to escape from the test early without executing the rest of the test.  A pair of macros support this functionality in Unity.  The first (TEST_PROTECT) sets up the feature, and handles emergency abort cases.  TEST_ABORT can then be used at any time within the tests to return to the last TEST_PROTECT call.

TEST_PROTECT()

Setup and Catch macro

TEST_ABORT()

Abort Test macro

Example:

main()
{
    if (TEST_PROTECT() == 0)
    {
        MyTest();
    }
}

If MyTest calls TEST_ABORT, program control will immediately return to TEST_PROTECT with a non-zero return value.

Unity Assertion Summary
=======================

--------------------
Basic Validity Tests
--------------------

TEST_ASSERT_TRUE(condition)

Evaluates whatever code is in condition and fails if it evaluates to false

TEST_ASSERT_FALSE(condition)

Evaluates whatever code is in condition and fails if it evaluates to true

TEST_ASSERT(condition)

Another way of calling TEST_ASSERT_TRUE

TEST_ASSERT_UNLESS(condition)

Another way of calling TEST_ASSERT_FALSE

TEST_FAIL()
TEST_FAIL_MESSAGE(message)

This test is automatically marked as a failure.  The message is output stating why.

------------------------------
Numerical Assertions: Integers
------------------------------

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(expected, actual)

Another way of calling TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT(expected, actual)

Compare two integers for equality and display errors as signed integers.

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_UINT(expected, actual)	

Compare two integers for equality and display errors as unsigned integers.

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_HEX8(expected, actual)	

Compare two integers for equality and display errors as an 8-bit hex value

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_HEX16(expected, actual)

Another way of calling TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_HEX32

TEST_ASSERT_INT_WITHIN(delta, expected, actual)

Asserts that the actual value is within plus or minus delta of the expected value.

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_MESSAGE(expected, actual, message)

Another way of calling TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT_MESSAGE

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT_MESSAGE(expected, actual, message)

Compare two integers for equality and display errors as signed integers.  Outputs a custom message on failure.

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_UINT_MESSAGE(expected, actual, message)

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_HEX_MESSAGE(expected, actual, message)
	
Another way of calling TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_HEX32_MESSAGE

------------------------------------
Numerical Assertions: Integer Arrays
------------------------------------

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT_ARRAY(expected, actual, num_elements)

Compare two arrays for equality and display errors as signed integers.

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_UINT_ARRAY(expected, actual, num_elements)

Compare two arrays for equality and display errors as unsigned integers.

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_HEX32_ARRAY(expected, actual, num_elements)

Compare two arrays for equality and display errors as 32-bit hex values.

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_HEX_ARRAY(expected, actual, num_elements)

Another way of calling TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_HEX32_ARRAY.

-----------------------------
Numerical Assertions: Bitwise
-----------------------------

TEST_ASSERT_BITS(mask, expected, actual)

Use an integer mask to specify which bits should be compared between two other integers.  High bits in the mask are compared, low bits ignored.

TEST_ASSERT_BITS_HIGH(mask, actual)

Use an integer mask to specify which bits should be inspected to determine if they are all set high.  High bits in the mask are compared, low bits ignored.

TEST_ASSERT_BITS_LOW(mask, actual)

Use an integer mask to specify which bits should be inspected to determine if they are all set low.  High bits in the mask are compared, low bits ignored.

TEST_ASSERT_BIT_HIGH(bit, actual)

Test a single bit and verify that it is high.  The bit is specified 0-31 for a 32-bit integer.

TEST_ASSERT_BIT_LOW(bit, actual)

Test a single bit and verify that it is low.  The bit is specified 0-31 for a 32-bit integer.

----------------------------
Numerical Assertions: Floats
----------------------------

TEST_ASSERT_FLOAT_WITHIN(delta, expected, actual)

Asserts that the actual value is within plus or minus delta of the expected value.

-----------------
String Assertions
-----------------

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_STRING(expected, actual)

Compare two null-terminate strings.  Fail if any character is different or if the lengths are different.

TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_STRING_MESSAGE(expected, actual, message)

Compare two null-terminate strings.  Fail if any character is different or if the lengths are different. Output a custom message on failure.

------------------
Pointer Assertions
------------------

Most pointer operations can be performed by simply using the integer comparisons above.  However, a couple of special cases are added for clarity.

TEST_ASSERT_NULL(pointer)

Fails if the pointer is not equal to NULL

TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(pointer)

Fails if the pointer is equal to NULL
